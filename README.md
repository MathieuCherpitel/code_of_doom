# code_of_doom

Just some random programs that are not useless but not useful, not fun but not boring, not great but not bad but I made them so...

# description

mr_clean : shell script to remove temp files (cPool)
prepare_my_repo_v1 : shell script to create repo for Epitech (cPool)
prepare_my_repo_v2 : updated version of prepare_my_repo_v1 never finished but kinda cool
open_terminal : shell script to open a terminal (I keep it to make a joke on someone's else computer)
template_dup : c program to automate massive file creation from an other file content (Yes I needed that at some point)
